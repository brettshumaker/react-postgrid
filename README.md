# React Post Grid WordPress Plugin
I started playing around with React the other day and wrote this plugin as a way to have a real goal instead of just a random tutorial online. This plugin provides a shortcode: `[react-postgrid]` that will render a React app that uses the WordPress REST API to generate a Category select box and, once a category is chosen, a paginated grid of posts from that category. Again, nothing fancy, just a way for me to learn React. 

This is **not** production ready, but feel free to poke around to see how I built it, and let me know if there's something I can do better.

### Installation
1. Download, install, and activate plugin
2. Place the `[react-postgrid]` shortcode in a theme template file or post/page content
